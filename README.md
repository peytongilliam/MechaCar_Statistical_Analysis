## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? The vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-Value was 5.35e-11.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?  The linear model would be considered to predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the r-squared value was 0.7149 or roughly 71% accurately determined.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
