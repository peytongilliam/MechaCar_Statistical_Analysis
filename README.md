Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? The vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because the p-Value was 5.35e-11.

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?  The linear model would be considered to predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because the r-squared value was 0.7149 or roughly 71% accurately determined.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?  The current manufacturing data meets the design specification for all manufacturing lots in total because the variance PSI is 62.29. Lots 1 and 2 meet the design specification individually as well because their variance PSIs are 0.979 and 7.469, but lot 3 does not because the variance PSI is 170.286.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

Based upon the p-value and mean of the sample above, all manufacturing lots are very similar to the mean of 1500.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

The metrics that I would test safety ratings, city and highway fuel efficiency, and maintenance cost. These to me and I'm sure a lot of consumers would be some of the most important metrics to test.
